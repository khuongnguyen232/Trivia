## Trivia

A fun web app that generates trivia questions and users can interact directly with their answer, the result will be displayed directly after the user hit their answer.
The technology is used in this project:
+ React to build the components
+ SASS and bootstrap for styling and responsive design
+ Data from Trivia API

## Instruction
If you want to run this locally, please follow these steps (assuming NodeJS is installed):
+ npm install
+ npm start

And the window of this web app should pop up on your browser at localhost:3000.

I already hosted the website on Heroku, if you want to have a small look at it please check out here:
